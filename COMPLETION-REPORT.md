## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Environment Limitation
**Bolt Environment** (current): 
- ❌ Does not support PHP runtime
- ❌ Does not support Docker execution
- ❌ Cannot run WordPress directly

**Reason**: WordPress requires PHP 8.x+ and MySQL/MariaDB, which are not available in Node.js-based Bolt environment.

### Solution
The project is **fully prepared and ready** but must be deployed to a PHP-capable environment:

**Recommended Options**:
1. **Docker** (easiest): Use `docker-compose up -d` on any Docker-capable server
2. **Traditional Hosting**: Upload to cPanel/Plesk with PHP 8.x + MySQL
3. **Managed WordPress**: Kinsta, WP Engine, or Cloudways
4. **PaaS**: DigitalOcean App Platform, Heroku with PHP buildpack
